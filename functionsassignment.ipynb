        "A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can be called by its name and can accept arguments and return values. A method, on the other hand, is a function that is associated with an object or class. It is called on an instance of that object or class and can access and modify the object's data. In simpler terms, methods are functions that belong to objects.\n",
        "2.Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "In Python, parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called. Parameters are like placeholders, while arguments are the concrete data you give to the function to work with.\n",

        "\n",
        "The return statement in a Python function serves two primary purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Exiting the function: It immediately stops the function's execution. Any code written after the return statement in that function will not be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Returning a value: It sends a value, or a set of values, back to the caller of the function. This allows the function's result to be used in other parts of the program, such as being assigned to a variable, used in an expression, or passed as an argument to another function.\n",
        "\n",
        "How return Works\n",
        "When you call a function, it performs a task. The return statement allows that function to provide the outcome of its task to the rest of your program. If a function doesn't have a return statement, it implicitly returns None.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a simple example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
        "    result = x + y\n",

        "sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(5, 10)\n",
        "print(sum_of_numbers)\n",
        "# Output: 15\n",
        "In this case, the add_numbers function calculates the sum and returns the result. The value 15 is then assigned to the variable sum_of_numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, an iterable is a data structure that can be looped over, while an iterator is an object that keeps track of the current position during that loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterables\n",
        "An iterable is any object that can return an iterator. Think of an iterable as a container that holds a series of items, like a list, tuple, or string. It has a special __iter__() method that, when called, creates and returns an iterator. You can iterate over an iterable using a for loop, which is the most common way to use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "__iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "__next__(): Returns the next item from the iterable. It raises a StopIteration error when there are no more items left.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can manually get an iterator from an iterable using the built-in iter() function and get the next item using next().\n",

        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "6.Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "Generators in Python are a special kind of function or expression that produce a sequence of results one at a time, instead of building a whole list and returning it all at once. They're iterators that are lazy, meaning they generate values on-demand. This makes them highly memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets, since they don't store the entire sequence in memory. ðŸ§ \n",
        "\n",
        "Defining Generators\n",
        "There are two primary ways to define a generator in Python: generator functions and generator expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generator Functions\n",
        "A generator function is a function that contains at least one yield statement. When this function is called, it doesn't execute the code and return a value immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object. The code inside the function only runs when you ask for the next item from this object (e.g., using a for loop, next() function, or by unpacking).\n",
        "\n",
        "The yield keyword is what makes a function a generator. It pauses the function's execution and saves its local state. When next() is called on the generator object again, the function resumes right where it left off, and its state is restored.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "def simple_generator():\n",
        "    print(\"Starting generator...\")\n",
        "    yield 1\n",
        "    print(\"Resuming...\")\n",
        "    yield 2\n",
        "    print(\"One more time...\")\n",
        "    yield 3\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create the generator object\n",
        "gen = simple_generator()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Iterate through the generator\n",
        "for value in gen:\n",
        "    print(value)\n",
        "The output of this code would be:\n",
        "\n",
        "Starting generator...\n",
        "1\n",
        "Resuming...\n",
        "2\n",
        "One more time...\n",
        "3\n",
        "Notice how the print statements are executed between the yield calls, showing the pausing and resuming behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generator Expressions\n",
        "A generator expression is a concise way to create a generator without defining a full function. They are syntactically similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses () instead of square brackets []. They are more memory-efficient than their list comprehension counterparts because they don't build the entire list in memory at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "# List comprehension (creates a list in memory)\n",
        "my_list = [x**2 for x in range(1000)]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Generator expression (creates a generator object)\n",
        "my_gen = (x**2 for x in range(1000))\n",
        "The my_list variable will hold all 1000 squared values in memory, whereas my_gen will only generate them one at a time as they are requested. This is a great choice when you need a simple generator and don't require the complex logic of a full generator function\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "Using generators offers several key advantages over regular functions, primarily related to memory efficiency and performance. Unlike regular functions that compute and return a single value or an entire list at once, generators produce values one at a time, on demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency\n",
        "This is the most significant advantage. Generators are lazy iterators, meaning they don't store the entire sequence in memory. A regular function returning a large list, for example, would have to build that entire list in memory before returning it. A generator, by contrast, only holds the state of the current item, yielding values one by one. This is crucial when working with very large datasets or infinite sequences, as it prevents your program from running out of memory. ðŸ§ \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance\n",
        "Because generators don't have to build an entire list or collection in memory, they can start producing results much faster. The time to first item is almost instantaneous, which is beneficial for data processing pipelines where you want to start working on the first few items without waiting for the entire set to be generated. This also reduces the initial processing overhead, as there's no need to allocate memory for the entire data structure. âš¡\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplicity and Readability\n",
        "For creating iterators, generator functions are often simpler and cleaner to write than implementing a custom class with __iter__ and __next__ methods. The yield keyword handles the state-saving logic automatically, making the code more concise and easier to read. For simple, single-line iterations, generator expressions offer an even more compact syntax\n",
        "8.What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but is restricted to a single expression, which is also its return value. They're called \"anonymous\" because they don't have a name like a regular function defined with def.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics\n",
        "Single Expression: A lambda function's body is a single expression, not a block of statements. This limits its complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "No return Statement: The expression's result is implicitly returned. You don't use the return keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concise: They are a compact way to create simple function objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typical Use Cases\n",
        "Lambda functions are most often used as arguments to higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as input. This is where their small, throwaway nature makes them perfect.\n",
        "\n",
        "With map(), filter(), and reduce(): These built-in functions apply a function to every item in an iterable. A lambda provides a quick, inline way to define the logic without needing a separate def function.\n",
        "\n",
        "map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3]) doubles each number.\n",
        "\n",
        "filter(lambda x: x > 5, [3, 6, 8]) keeps numbers greater than 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sorting with key: The sorted() function and the .sort() method of lists have a key argument. This argument accepts a function that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list. Lambda functions are the perfect, lightweight tool for this.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "# Sort a list of tuples based on the second element\n",
        "data = [('apple', 3), ('banana', 1), ('cherry', 2)]\n",
        "sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda item: item[1])\n",
        "# sorted_data will be [('banana', 1), ('cherry', 2), ('apple', 3)]\n",
        "In essence, you use a lambda function whenever you need a small, simple function for a short period of time, and defining a full-fledged def function would be overkill.\n",
        "9.Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "The map() function in Python applies a given function to every item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and returns a map object, which is a special type of iterator. The purpose of map() is to perform a transformation on a collection of items efficiently, without explicitly writing a loop. ðŸ”„\n",
        "\n",
        "How It Works\n",
        "The syntax of map() is map(function, iterable, ...).\n",

        "function: The function to be applied to each item. It can be a built-in function, a custom function, or a lambda function.\n",

        "\n",
        "map() doesn't execute the function immediately. Instead, it creates an iterator that yields results on-demand, which makes it memory-efficient, especially for large datasets. You can convert the map object to a list or another iterable to see the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python are all part of the functional programming paradigm, but they serve different purposes. The key difference lies in what they do to an iterable (like a list) and what they return.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. map(): Transformation ðŸ”„\n",
        "The map() function is used to transform an iterable by applying a function to every item in it. It returns a new iterable (a map object) of the same length, where each element is the result of the function applied to the original element.
